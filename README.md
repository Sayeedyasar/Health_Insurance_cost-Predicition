# Health_Insurance_cost-Predicition

## Description
This project is a Python-based data science application designed to analyze insurance data. It involves data preprocessing, cleaning, and applying machine learning techniques to derive insights and predictions related to insurance costs. The primary objective is to explore patterns in insurance charges based on various demographic and medical attributes.

## How It Works
Data Loading: The project loads insurance data from a CSV file.

## Data Cleaning:
Handles missing values by dropping null records.
Converts categorical data (e.g., gender, smoker status) into a standardized format.
Transforms monetary values into numerical formats.

## Feature Engineering:
Encodes categorical variables such as region and smoker status.
Scales numerical features for machine learning.

## Machine Learning Model:
Applies standardization using StandardScaler.
Implements cross-validation for evaluating model performance.
Uses mean squared error (MSE) as an evaluation metric.

## Features
Loads and preprocesses insurance data
Cleans and formats categorical and numerical data
Applies feature engineering for better model performance
Uses machine learning to analyze and predict insurance charges
Evaluates model performance using cross-validation and MSE
